# VUTTR api

VUTTR (Very Useful Tools to Remember) is a simple repository to manage tools with their respective names, links, descriptions and tags.

It is an backend admission test made by [Bossabox](https://www.bossabox.com/) made available by [CollabCodeTech's backend-challenges](https://github.com/CollabCodeTech/backend-challenges). This mini app was made for practice purposes while I travel on transport. I'm trying to be as pure as possible in the Javascript language, so I'll avoid framework and library (except a few) as much as possible.

The test is available [here](https://www.notion.so/Back-end-0b2c45f1a00e4a849eefe3b1d57f23c6)
